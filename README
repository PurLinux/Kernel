These are a collection of kernel configs and patches.

The source to the Linux kernel can always be found at https://kernel.org

Download the source tarball of the kernel that corresponds with the config you want to use. e.g.

	pur_4.5.0.config

would correspond to version 4.5(.0) of the Linux kernel, found at:

	https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/linux-4.5.tar.xz

From there, it's normal kernel compilation- load the config and start making. Optionally patch in the supplied patches for that version (if any).


Some useful resources to get you started:

https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Kernel/Configuration

(Obviously you can ignore distro-specific tools, such as emerge and eselect, mentioned in the above.)
