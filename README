These are a collection of kernel configs and patches.

The source to the Linux kernel can always be found at https://kernel.org

Download the source tarball of the kernel that corresponds with the config you want to use. e.g.

	pur_4.5.0.config

would correspond to version 4.5(.0) of the Linux kernel, found at:

	https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/linux-4.5.tar.xz

ALTERNATIVELY, we attach the canonical upstream kernel sources as a submodule. You can simply do:

  $ git submodule update --init

and it will fetch the kernel sources for you. Note that this is a *very large* repository, so it will take a fair bit of time to fetch.
They can be found in <project path>/upstream/. The releases should be tagged, so if you are following the example above of 4.5.0, you would change directory to 'upstream' and run:

  $ git checkout v4.5

From there, it's normal kernel compilation- load the config and start making. Optionally patch in the supplied patches for that version (if any).

(Obviously you can ignore distro-specific tools, such as emerge and eselect, mentioned in the above.)
